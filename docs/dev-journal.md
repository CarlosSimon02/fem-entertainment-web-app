# Developer's Journal

This is a document where I list tasks to complete before starting my day. Its purpose is also to record what I learn during development. I don't do this often, but I think it will help me stay productive and avoid procrastination. Planning tasks before coding can prevent mental blocks. Additionally, documenting what I learn is important because I tend to forget things. This way, I can review the file during free time.

## Goals

### How the project should appear?

When the development is done, the code should be well-organized and follow good practices. It needs to be easy to read, able to scale if needed, and ensure good performance and high accessibility standards.

### When is the project expected to finish?

The aim is to complete the project by **March 8, 2024**. I started on **February 18, 2024**, so I have around **19 days** to finish.

## Actions

### For Time Efficiency

- Avoid opening social media, except for Reddit and YouTube, to prevent distractions.
- List all tasks for the day before starting coding.
- Plan and allocate time effectively for each task.
- Be flexible to adjust the plan if needed to meet the deadline.

### For High Quality Output

- Use clear variable and function names.
- Add comments if necessary.
- Regularly review and refactor code for clarity and efficiency.
- Prioritize simplicity in design and implementation.
- Consider potential future project requirements while coding.
- Ensure adherence to accessibility standards throughout the development process.

### For Becoming a Better Developer

- Avoid rushing; ensure a thorough understanding.
- Document daily learnings during the process.
